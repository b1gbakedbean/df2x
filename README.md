# Delta Force 2 - eXtended (df2x)
An executable (.exe) mod that aims to bring QoL improvements and additional features to the game, accomplished by patching via a DLL.

## Installation / How to use
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/b1gbakedbean/df2x/releases/latest)
2. Extract the contents of the zip file (`df2x-VERSION.zip`) to your game directory
   - If you use a DirectDraw to DirectX wrapper (such as dgVoodoo), rename the wrapper to end with `.alt.dll` (i.e. `DDraw.alt.dll`). This will allow you to use both this DLL and the DirectDraw to DirectX wrapper together.
3. Run the game as you normally would through `Df2.exe`

# Notice
- This is currently and will likely remain a hobby/passion project (aka I won't always have time to work on this, and it's possible to go uncompleted).
- ***Heavily a WIP!***
